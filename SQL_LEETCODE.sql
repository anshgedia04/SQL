-- Write a solution to find the rank of the scores. The ranking should be calculated according to the following rules:

-- The scores should be ranked from the highest to the lowest.

-- If there is a tie between two scores, both should have the same ranking.

-- After a tie, the next ranking number should be the next consecutive integer value. In other words, there should be no holes between ranks.

-- Return the result table ordered by score in descending order.
